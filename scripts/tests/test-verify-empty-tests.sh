# test-verify-empty-tests.sh — an empty scripts/tests/ must FAIL, not pass.
#
# THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (spooky-shell-rlm, found 2026-09-02 alongside vv8):
# run_scripts iterated `scripts/tests/test-*.sh` and returned 0 when the glob
# matched nothing, so an empty or emptied tests directory reported the
# tests-of-the-gates suite as PASS while running nothing. Same class as vv8:
# not a gate that fails, a gate that is absent and looks satisfied. It matters
# most in the template because init.sh prunes layers by DELETION — but a prune
# deletes the whole directory (reported SKIPPED, which stays legitimate), so a
# directory that EXISTS with no tests means the tests vanished, and that must
# be red. This test pins both sides of that distinction.
