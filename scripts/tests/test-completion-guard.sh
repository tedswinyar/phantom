# test-completion-guard.sh — prove the completion guard discriminates.
#
# "the gate passed" is worthless information unless the gate would have failed.
# On macOS bash 3.2, a script with `set -e`, `set -u` AND an EXIT trap exits 0 when
# an unbound variable aborts it, so a crashed gate reports success.
# scripts/lib/completion-guard.sh fixes that; this test is what stops it being
# silently removed or broken.
#
# It builds throwaway scripts in a temp dir and runs the REAL guard from
# scripts/lib/completion-guard.sh against each, asserting BOTH directions:
#
#   guarded + completes normally  -> exit 0        (a guard that always fails is useless)
#   guarded + set -u abort        -> exit nonzero  (a guard that never fires is a lie)
#   guarded + bare exit 0         -> exit nonzero  (an exit that skipped finish() is premature)
#   guarded + finish 3            -> exit 3        (deliberate statuses survive)
#   guarded + command failure     -> exit nonzero
#
# and then the three control cases that pin the trigger matrix documented in
# completion-guard.sh — the bug needs -e AND -u AND a trap, so removing any one of
# them must restore a correct nonzero exit:
#
#   UNGUARDED set -euo pipefail + trap -> exit 0        (the bug, reproduced)
#   UNGUARDED bare set -u      + trap -> exit nonzero  (no -e: not affected)
#   UNGUARDED set -euo pipefail, none -> exit nonzero  (no trap: not affected)
#
# Those controls are the point. If a future bash stops swallowing the abort, the
# first flips and this test fails loudly — the signal to re-measure rather than to
# keep carrying the guard on faith. And if the matrix in completion-guard.sh is
# ever edited to something untrue, the other two catch it.
#
# It sources the real guard rather than restating its logic, so weakening
# completion-guard.sh breaks THIS test. A test carrying its own copy of the guard
# would just be testing its copy.
