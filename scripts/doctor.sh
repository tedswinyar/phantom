# every release-tier miss FATAL. This is what the build server runs before a
# release (docs/build-server.md), and what an operator runs once after
# provisioning a build machine. Each credential is checked by DOING the cheap
# version of the real thing — resolving the identity, listing notary history,
# reading the key — not by looking for a file.
